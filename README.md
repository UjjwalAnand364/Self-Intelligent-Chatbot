# Self-Intelligent-Chatbot
This repository contains Python files for a chat software, the client and server and a json file consisting of user intents while chatting with the bot.
We need to build exclusive code that allows users to talk to a intelligent bot (without connecting over).
ML will be used to upgrade the intents.json file, to elicit a wide range of input and responses.
